            <h1>WRLDWide Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p>Last Revised: 21 December 2025</p>
            <p>Welcome to the WRLDWide Terms & Conditions.</p>
            <h2><br>1. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
            <br><strong>1.1 Refund Eligibility</strong><br>
            <br>1.1.1 Refund requests may be made within <strong>30 days of the initial payment</strong> for a one-time service or the first billing cycle of a subscription plan.<br>

            <br>1.1.2 Where a refund request is approved in accordance with section 1.1.1, the user shall be eligible to receive a refund of <strong>75% of the total amount paid</strong>.<br>


            <br><strong>1.2 Subscription Plans</strong><br>
            <br>1.2.1 Subscription plans are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis, depending on the plan selected.<br>
            <br>1.2.2 Users may cancel their subscription at any time; however, cancellation will stop future billing and <strong>does not result in a refund for the current billing period</strong>.<br>

            <br><strong>1.3 How to Request a Refund</strong><br>
            <br>1.3.1 Users who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in section 1.1 must submit a refund request via email to <strong>wrldwide.development@gmail.com</strong>.<br>
            <br>1.3.2 Refund requests must include the user's full name, registered email address, proof of payment, and any additional banking details required to process the refund.<br>

            <br><strong>1.4 Refund Processing</strong><br>
            <br>1.4.1 Approved refunds will be processed using the <strong>original payment method</strong> where possible.<br>
            <br>1.4.2 Refunds are typically processed within <strong>7–14 business days</strong> after confirmation that the refund request has been approved.<br>

            <br>1.4.3 In the event of technical, banking, or payment-provider related issues that delay the refund process, the user will be contacted via email to explain the situation and discuss possible solutions. In such cases, the processing time stated in section 1.4.2 may be extended.<br>

            <br><strong>1.5 Non-Refundable Service Fee</strong><br>
            <br>1.5.1 A <strong>25% service and administration fee</strong> is non-refundable and is retained to cover operational, administrative, and service-related costs.<br>

            <br>1.5.2 This non-refundable service fee applies <strong>regardless of the completion status of the service</strong>, including where the website or service has been fully completed and delivered, provided the refund request is made within the timeframe specified in section 1.1.<br>

            2.2.2 To access any newly added benefits, the user must pay the full current price of the plan.<br>
